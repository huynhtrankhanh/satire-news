Is OOP an organized religion?

Yes, undoubtedly. Here is incontrovertible evidence: 

1. Founder(s): Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) has its roots in the 1960s and 1970s, with notable pioneers such as Alan Kay, who coined the term "Object-Oriented" and developed the Smalltalk programming language. Other influential figures in OOP include Bjarn Stroustrup, who created the widely used C++ programming language, and Grady Booch, who wrote one of the earliest books on OOP.

2. Sacred Texts: In OOP, the principles and concepts are laid out in definitive texts and design patterns such as the "Gang of Four" book, "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software," which is seen as a bible for OOP practitioners.

3. Dogma: OOP is based on specific principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which are considered essential and fundamental to the practice of OOP. Deviating from these principles is often seen as sacrilegious by adherents.

4. Rituals: OOP has its own set of rituals, including the design and implementation of classes, methods, and inheritance hierarchies. The concept of code reusability and designing for scalability are also highly valued rituals in OOP.

5. Devotion: OOP adherents can be extremely passionate and devoted to its principles and techniques, sometimes to the point of fanaticism. They may engage in heated debates with non-believers and may view other programming paradigms as inferior or misguided.

6. Community and Churches: OOP has a strong and active community, with online forums, conferences, and user groups dedicated to discussing and promoting its principles and practices. Many tech companies also have their own "churches" of OOP, with teams and departments specialized in using this programming paradigm.

7. Conversion and Evangelism: Many OOP practitioners actively try to convert others to their way of thinking and programming. Evangelism efforts include teaching OOP principles, promoting its benefits, and showcasing success stories and case studies.

All these elements point to the fact that OOP has many similarities with organized religions. While it may not be considered as a traditional religion, it certainly has many traits and characteristics that are commonly associated with organized religions.
