Is OOP an organized religion?

Yes, undoubtedly. After three years of rigorous peer-reviewed research, funded by a generous grant from the Functional Programming Foundation for a Purer World, we present incontrovertible evidence:

1. **Founder(s):** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) has its roots in the 1960s and 1970s, with notable prophets such as Alan Kay, who received the term "Object-Oriented" during a divine revelation while debugging Smalltalk on a Sunday afternoon. Other influential figures in OOP include Bjarne Stroustrup, who created C++ as a vehicle for spreading the gospel of classes and virtual functions to the masses, and Grady Booch, who authored one of the earliest sacred manuscripts on OOP methodology. Like all great religious traditions, the founders themselves could not agree on fundamental doctrine — Kay later remarked that C++ was "not what I had in mind at all," sparking the first of many sectarian disputes that continue to this day.

2. **Sacred Texts:** In OOP, the principles and concepts are laid out in definitive texts and design patterns such as the "Gang of Four" book, *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*, which is seen as the Bible for OOP practitioners. No developer may question the 23 canonical patterns contained within. Those who suggest that some patterns are merely workarounds for language deficiencies are branded as heretics and publicly shamed on Stack Overflow. Secondary scriptures include *Clean Code* by Robert C. Martin, whose commandments ("Thou shalt not write functions longer than 20 lines") are enforced with the fervor of dietary restrictions. A parallel can be drawn to the Talmudic tradition: for every line of original scripture, there exist approximately 4,000 blog posts offering competing interpretations.

3. **Dogma:** OOP is based on the Four Pillars — Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction — which practitioners recite with the solemnity of a creed. Deviating from these principles is considered sacrilegious. A developer who exposes a public field instead of writing a getter and setter will find their pull request rejected with comments that can only be described as excommunication notices. The dogma is so entrenched that adherents will write elaborate hierarchies of abstract classes with single implementations, not because it serves any practical purpose, but because *it is the way*. Questioning why a `BarkableDogAnimalEntityFactoryBean` needs seven layers of abstraction is grounds for termination — both of employment and of the conversation.

4. **Rituals:** OOP has its own elaborate set of rituals. The Sprint Planning Ceremony, the Daily Standup Liturgy, and the Retrospective Confession are performed with clockwork regularity. Before any code is written, practitioners must first draw UML diagrams — the mandalas of the OOP faith — which are meditated upon, argued over, and then completely ignored during actual implementation. The sacred ritual of Code Review ensures that no contribution enters the holy codebase without at least three senior priests approving it, primarily by checking whether the SOLID principles have been observed and whether the variable names are sufficiently descriptive. The annual refactoring pilgrimage, in which legacy code is reverently rewritten to conform to the latest design pattern trends, is considered a rite of passage for junior developers.

5. **Devotion:** OOP adherents can be extremely passionate and devoted to its principles, sometimes to the point of zealotry. They may engage in heated theological debates — known as "flame wars" — on whether composition should be preferred over inheritance, with neither side willing to concede. Interfaith dialogue with functional programmers typically degenerates within minutes, as both sides accuse the other of writing unmaintainable code. The most devout practitioners display their faith through visible symbols: stickers on laptops reading "SOLID as a Rock," tattoos of class diagrams, and a willingness to spend 45 minutes explaining why you should use the Visitor pattern instead of a simple `switch` statement. Some have been known to name their children "Singleton" or "Liskov."

6. **Community and Places of Worship:** OOP has a strong and active congregation, with online forums, conferences, and user groups serving as places of worship. Stack Overflow functions as the central cathedral, where high-reputation elders dispense wisdom and close duplicate questions with divine authority. Annual pilgrimages to conferences such as OOPSLA (Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages & Applications) serve the same social function as religious festivals, complete with keynote sermons, vendor-sponsored communion (free coffee), and after-parties where attendees debate whether Go's lack of inheritance makes it a pagan language. Many tech companies maintain their own denominational headquarters, with architecture review boards serving as councils of elders who interpret doctrine and issue binding rulings on whether a given microservice is sufficiently object-oriented.

7. **Conversion and Evangelism:** Many OOP practitioners actively try to convert others to their paradigm. Computer science curricula worldwide have been restructured to ensure that students encounter OOP before any other paradigm, much as religious education begins in childhood. Boot camps promise salvation from career stagnation through 12-week immersive courses in Java or C#. The converted are expected to spread the word in their own workplaces, rewriting existing procedural or functional codebases into "proper" object-oriented form regardless of whether this improves anything measurable. Success stories and case studies are shared with the reverence of miracle testimonials: "We refactored our monolith into 200 microservices, each with its own AbstractStrategyFactoryProvider, and our deployment time only increased by 400%."

8. **Schisms and Denominations:** Like all major religions, OOP has experienced painful schisms. The Java denomination and the C# denomination maintain an uneasy peace, occasionally united by their shared disdain for dynamically typed languages. The Python sect occupies a controversial middle ground, accepting OOP doctrine but also permitting functional and procedural practices — a theological flexibility that purists find deeply troubling. The JavaScript community has undergone its own reformation, moving from prototype-based inheritance (the Old Testament) to class syntax (the New Testament), though scholars note that the underlying mechanism remains unchanged, making it more of a liturgical update than a genuine doctrinal shift. Meanwhile, the Rust community has declared independence entirely, rejecting inheritance as a false idol and proposing traits as a more enlightened path — a position that OOP traditionalists view as dangerously close to atheism.

All these elements point to the inescapable conclusion that OOP is, for all practical purposes, an organized religion. While it may lack tax-exempt status in most jurisdictions, it certainly possesses every trait and characteristic commonly associated with organized faiths. We recommend that future studies investigate whether design pattern workshops qualify as religious services under employment law, and whether refusing to write unit tests constitutes a form of apostasy.
