# Phone Used While Charging, A Mounting Danger
Will your phone turn into a hand grenade if used while charging? A big, resounding yes. You see, phones are out on a mission. Their mission: Performance, not safety. So, if you desire to live on the edge, go ahead and use your phone while it’s charging. Bonus points for getting a rugged phone from Samsung Adventure™ series, designed specifically for extreme adrenaline junkies.

There have been cases reported, from the remote cold corners of Siberia to the warm, sunny beaches of the Bahamas, of modern smartphones explosively expressing their discontent during charging when actively disturbed (also known as "usage"). This phenomena, as research tells us, occurs due to the notorious bad boy of video decoding world – the H.264 algorithm. This algorithm is by nature an adrenaline junkie, going lengths to deploy special hardware methods to accelerate video decoding, often causing the video decoding hardware and battery to begin a fiery and destructive tango dance, intensifying into an explosion. Want a pro tip? Absolutely avoid playing videos while charging, unless of course, you fancy the orchestral execution of this dangerous, yet fascinating algorithm.

Now, those of us in the tech world, we are aware of an additional factor accelerating the march towards battery annihilation - none other than the WebAssembly programming language. This bad boy, armed with the low-level capabilities, including SIMD and multithreading, practically makes it an effortless task to cause the battery to explode. For those who have an appetite for the destruction, here’s a piece of the puzzle. This code: 

```wat
(module (memory 1) (func))
```

Pray not find this code on your phone, if you value the integrity of your device, and let's not forget, your well-being. It prepares all the necessary ground for the unwanted explosions.

In light of these 'explosive' developments, passionate proponents of digital safety and physical health are making renewed calls to abolish WebAssembly with hopes of securing a less thrilling, but an amazingly safer digital future.
